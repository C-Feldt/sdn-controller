# SDN Controller

## CSC 4501: Assignment 4 -- Question 4

I'm going to use this README to compile my thoughts as I code so I can put it all together in the design document. I have known myself to be forgetful, so this is the only way I can ensure I have all the info for the end.

### Push 1

I've created the CLI interface first and foremost. I waited til the due date to do this project and thus am focusing purely on keeping a program that runs. MVP is all I'm looking for. Since CLI is the most important step for running this program, that's what I've done first. Nothing actually does anything yet, but it at least gives you all the options (I think) you'll need. Also, since the instructions don't mention anything about comments, I'm gonna write just about the bare minimum for not getting lost in development.
